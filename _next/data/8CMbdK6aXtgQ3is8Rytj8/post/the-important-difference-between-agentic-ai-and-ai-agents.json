Agentic AI is concerned with researching and developing AI models capable of the type of independent, autonomous work that agents can do.\n\nThink of AI agents as specific medicines prescribed for particular conditions, while agentic AI is the entire field of pharmaceutical science that develops all medications.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is in the context of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – the future goal of one day creating AIs that are generalists rather than specialists, capable of any task we ask them to help out with.\n\nToday’s AI agents are not AGI – and they probably won’t be for a few years yet. Yes, they can carry out complex tasks, but still only specific tasks they were created for. They can’t really apply their learning to doing other things in the same way humans can.\n\nAgentic AI, however, is a field of AI research and development some believe will eventually lead to AGI. It includes building AIs that are capable of interacting with external systems – both digitally by interfacing with them and physically with robotics.\n\nSo, to put it in a very straightforward way – the term “AI agents” refers to a specific application of agentic AI, and “agentic” refers to the AI models, algorithms and methods that make them work.\n\n## Why Is This Important?\n\nAI agents and agentic AI are two closely related concepts that everyone needs to understand if they’re planning on using technology to make a difference in the coming years.\n\nAs research and development into agentic AI continues, we will see increasingly sophisticated agents capable of automating many different tasks.\n\nTruly useful and personalized digital assistants, capable of learning about what we need in detail and taking steps to help us achieve it, will just be the start.\n\nIntegrated with robotics, agents will also open the door to the automation of physical tasks, such as complex construction or engineering work.\n\nWith the massive and rapid advancements we’re seeing in AI, I think it’s likely these changes will take place at a speed that will take many of us by surprise.\n\nStaying ahead of the curve now and understanding the latest developments in AI, robotics and automation is essential for anyone who wants to prosper in the new technological era.\n\n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BernardMarr) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/).\n\nCheck out my [website](https://bernardmarr.com/) or [some of my other work](https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1846).","datePosted":"2025-03-08T06:59:09.770389Z","postedBy":"Elijah Mondero","tags":["AI","Agentic AI","AI Agents","Technology","Innovation","Enterprise Tech"],"sources":["https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/02/25/the-important-difference-between-agentic-ai-and-ai-agents/"],"image_path":"/posts/images/7fa2e780-a966-4044-8fc7-3ea93f3ee544.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
