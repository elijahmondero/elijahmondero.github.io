They’re often used interchangeably, and this can cause a little confusion as they refer to subtly different concepts.\n\nSo, what are they and how are they different?\n\nBoth concepts relate to AI systems that can work through multi-step problems independently, with little guidance from humans. However, there are key distinctions between them.\n\n### AI Agents\n\nAI agents are specific applications created to independently handle specific tasks. They are already widely in use today, even if we don’t often notice them. For example, banks use AI agents to verify identities, automate transactions, manage record-keeping, and learn customer preferences to improve services.\n\n### Agentic AI\n\nAgentic AI, on the other hand, refers to the overall field of AI that enables machines to operate as agents. It's focused on researching and developing AI models capable of the kind of independent, autonomous work that agents perform. It's like regarding AI agents as specific medicines for particular conditions, while agentic AI encompasses the entire field of pharmaceutical science developing those medications.\n\nAnother way to understand the difference is through the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – the ultimate aim to create AIs that are generalists rather than specialists. Current AI agents handle complex tasks but are limited to specific domains they were designed for. They can't apply their learning to other tasks in the same way humans can. Agentic AI research and development aim to eventually achieve AGI, creating systems that can interact with external environments both digitally and physically through robotics.\n\n### Why Is Understanding This Important?\n\nAI agents and agentic AI are closely related and will have significant impacts on the future of technology. As agentic AI develops, we will see increasingly sophisticated agents automating a wide array of tasks. This includes advanced digital assistants that learn detailed user preferences and take proactive steps to assist, and integrated robotic systems performing complex physical tasks.\n\nThe massive advancements expected in AI suggest these changes could occur rapidly, possibly catching many off guard. Staying informed about the latest developments in AI, robotics, and automation is essential for anyone aiming to thrive in the coming technological era.\n","datePosted":"2025-03-08T08:57:00.055775Z","postedBy":"Elijah Mondero","tags":["AI","Technology","Business","Innovation","Agentic AI","AI Agents"],"sources":["Forbes"],"image_path":"/posts/images/66a0b2fe-ba5d-49e1-97a7-5ef74080cab2.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
