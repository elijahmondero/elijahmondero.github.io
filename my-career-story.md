### Chapter 1: Humble Beginnings

My journey began in a small town, where I developed a passion for technology and problem-solving. As a child, I would often dismantle gadgets just to understand the magic inside them. This curiosity laid the foundation for my career in tech.

### Chapter 2: The Fiserv Experience

Joining Fiserv was a significant milestone in my career. It was here that I honed my skills in software development and gained exposure to the financial services industry. Working on diverse projects, I learned the importance of delivering reliable and secure software. My time at Fiserv was marked by continuous learning and professional growth.

### Chapter 3: A New Home in New Zealand

Seeking long-term stability, my journey took me to New Zealand. My first role at Fiserv was a great introduction to the local tech scene and my first formal experience with Agile, working in sprints on their mobile banking platform. My dedication to delivering features was recognized when I was named **Most Valuable Player** for September 2014. After six months, I sought a role that better suited our family's move towards a suburban lifestyle and offered a much closer workplace on the North Shore.

This led me to RAMM Software, a smaller company where I would spend nearly eight years. Though my title was Senior Developer, I carried the responsibilities of a Technical Lead. This role was the most front-end intensive of my career. We were migrating a legacy Delphi desktop application to a modern SaaS platform. This wasn't just any app; it was the asset management software used by nearly every council in New Zealand to manage the nation's roading infrastructure.

### Chapter 4: The Cloud and AI Frontier

The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and I knew I had to stay ahead of the curve. I immersed myself in learning about cloud computing and artificial intelligence. This knowledge not only enhanced my skill set but also opened up new avenues for innovation in my projects.

### Chapter 5: Embracing the Future

Today, I stand at the forefront of technology, ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. My journey has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a passion for creating impactful solutions. As I look to the future, I am excited about the possibilities that await and the role I will play in shaping the tech landscape of tomorrow.
