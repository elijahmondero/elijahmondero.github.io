  "content": "# Building Predictable AI Workflows with Google ADK's SequentialAgent\n\nThe world of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, moving beyond simple models towards sophisticated, autonomous agents capable of tackling complex tasks. To help developers navigate this new frontier and build powerful multi-agent systems, Google introduced the open-source **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.\n\nADK is a Python toolkit designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of building, evaluating, and deploying intelligent AI agents. It provides a modular and extensible framework that makes creating intricate agentic applications more manageable.\n\n## Orchestrating Agentic Workflows with ADK\n\nA core strength of ADK lies in its ability to create **agentic workflows**. These workflows define how individual agents collaborate or how a single agent performs a series of distinct operations. ADK offers different types of agents specifically designed to manage these orchestration patterns.\n\nOne key category is **Workflow Agents**. Unlike **LLM Agents**, which rely on a large language model for dynamic reasoning and flow control, Workflow Agents orchestrate other agents or tools in predictable, predefined patterns *without* the need for an LLM to dictate the sequence. This makes them ideal for structured, repeatable processes where the steps are known in advance.\n\n## Introducing the SequentialAgent\n\nWithin the Workflow Agent category, the **SequentialAgent** stands out for its straightforward, step-by-step execution model. As its name implies, a SequentialAgent is designed to execute a series of defined sub-agents, tools, or functions in a strict, predetermined order.\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of a sequential workflow is that one task or sub-agent must complete successfully before the next one in the sequence can begin. This ensures a clear, linear execution path towards accomplishing a larger goal.\n\n## How SequentialAgent Works (Conceptually)\n\nConceptually, a SequentialAgent acts like a conductor guiding an orchestra, where each musician (sub-agent or tool) plays their part in a specific order. When the SequentialAgent is invoked with an initial input, it iterates through its predefined list of steps.\n\nIt calls the first step, waits for it to complete, and then calls the second step, potentially passing the output of the first step as input to the second. This process continues until the final step is executed, and its output becomes the final result of the sequential workflow.\n\n## Illustrative Code Structure (Based on ADK Concepts)\n\nWhile a direct, runnable example of a `SequentialAgent` class wasn't available in the research content, based on the descriptions of Workflow Agents and general ADK principles, defining a sequential workflow involves specifying the individual steps (agents or tools) and then composing them using a mechanism provided by ADK.\n\nHere's an *illustrative* conceptual structure demonstrating how you might define and run a sequential workflow using elements based on ADK patterns:\n\n```python\n# This is an illustrative example based on ADK concepts and documentation descriptions.\n# The actual implementation details and class names for SequentialAgent may vary.\n\n# Assume we have basic agents or tools defined for individual steps\n# In a real ADK scenario, these would likely be classes inheriting from ADK base classes\n# from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent # Example sub-agent type\n# from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool # Example tool type\n\n# Step 1: Define the individual steps/sub-agents as classes or functions\n# These steps contain the logic for each part of the workflow\nclass DataIngestionStep:\n    def process(self, input_data):\n        print(\"Executing Data Ingestion Step\")\n        # --- Your data ingestion logic here ---\n        processed_data = f\"Ingested: {input_data}\"\n        return processed_data # Output passed to the next step\n\nclass DataProcessingStep:\n    def process(self, input_data): # Accepts output from previous step\n        print(\"Executing Data Processing Step with input:\", input_data)\n        # --- Your data processing logic here ---\n        transformed_data = f\"Processed: {input_data.upper()}\"\n        return transformed_data # Output for the next step or final result\n\n# ... define more steps like DataAnalysisStep, ReportingStep, etc.\n\n# Step 2: Compose the steps using a SequentialAgent (conceptual implementation)\n# ADK would likely provide a class or function to chain these steps\n# The exact syntax below is hypothetical but represents the concept\n\n# from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent # Assuming this class exists in ADK\n\n# Imagine constructing the sequential workflow like this:\n# sequential_workflow = SequentialAgent(\n#     name=\"MyMultiStepDataPipeline\",\n#     steps=[\n#         DataIngestionStep(),\n#         DataProcessingStep()\n#         # Add instances of other steps in the desired order\n#     ]\n# )\n\n# Step 3: Run the sequential workflow using an ADK Runner (conceptual)\n# ADK typically uses runner and session mechanisms to execute agents/workflows\n\n# from google.adk.runners import Runner\n# from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService # Or other session types\n\n# runner = Runner(session_service=InMemorySessionService())\n# final_pipeline_result = runner.run(sequential_workflow, initial_input=\"Raw Data File Path\")\n\n# print(\"Sequential workflow finished. Final result:\", final_pipeline_result)\n\n# Note: This code block is illustrative based on descriptions. Refer to the official\n# Google ADK documentation and examples for precise implementation details,\n# class names (like SequentialAgent), and usage for defining and running\n# sequential workflows, as a complete runnable example was not found in the scraped content.\n```\n\nThis illustrative example highlights the core idea: defining the individual components (steps) and then assembling them in order using a dedicated workflow orchestrator like SequentialAgent.\n\n## Benefits and Use Cases\n\nSequential workflows, orchestrated by agents like the SequentialAgent in ADK, are incredibly useful for scenarios where:\n\n*   **Strict Ordering is Required:** Tasks *must* be performed in a specific sequence (e.g., data validation before processing).\n*   **Complex Tasks are Broken Down:** A large, complex problem is more manageable when split into smaller, linear steps.\n*   **Predictability and Repeatability are Key:** You need a reliable, automated process that executes the same steps every time.\n*   **Step Output is Next Step Input:** The result of one operation is necessary data for the subsequent operation.\n\nPractical use cases include data processing pipelines (Extract -> Transform -> Load), multi-stage approval flows, guided customer onboarding processes, or any automation where steps follow a defined checklist.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Google Agent Development Kit provides powerful tools for building sophisticated AI systems. For developers needing to implement workflows with a clear, ordered execution path, the SequentialAgent (or the equivalent mechanism within ADK for sequential orchestration) is a fundamental component. By defining individual steps and composing them sequentially, you can create predictable, robust, and easily understandable agent behaviors. As you explore ADK, remember to consult the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date implementation details and examples.\n",
