  "content": "Thank you for providing the initial step of the research process.\nHowever, the text you provided outlines the *plan* for researching 'vibe coding' (e.g., 'First, I will search for the term 'vibe coding'...') rather than presenting the actual findings or information *about* 'vibe coding' itself.\n\nTo craft the compelling blog post you requested, complete with an engaging title, concise excerpt, and detailed content, I require the actual findings from your research. This should include:\n*   A definition or explanation of what 'vibe coding' is.\n*   Context or examples of where it is used or discussed.\n*   Any insights, applications, or criticisms uncovered during your search.\n*   Specific source URLs where this information was located.\n\nPlease provide the completed research findings that contain the information gathered about 'vibe coding'. Once I have these results, I can then craft the blog post in the requested format, including the title, excerpt, content, date, author, tags, and source URLs.",
