  "content": "If you\u2019ve been reading about business technology recently, then \u201cAI agents\u201d and \u201cagentic AI\u201d are terms you\u2019ve probably come across with increasing frequency.\n\nThey\u2019re often used interchangeably, and I\u2019ve noticed this can cause a little confusion as they refer to subtly different concepts.\n\nAs it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been asked about, I thought I\u2019d put together a little explainer.\n\nRemember, AI is a quickly evolving subject, and the terminology around it is evolving, too.\n\nSo here\u2019s an overview of AI agents and agentic AI, and most importantly, a guide to telling the difference.\n\n## So What Are They And How Are They Different?\n\nOk, both concepts are used to refer to AI that can work through multi-step problems independently, with little guidance from humans.\n\nAI agents are specific applications created to do just this and are already widely in use today, even if we don\u2019t often see them.\n\nThey\u2019re used by banks and in e-commerce to verify our identities, automate transactions and record keeping, and learn about us in order to improve their service.\n\nAgentic AI, on the other hand, refers to the field of AI that enables machines to operate as agents. Agentic AI is concerned with researching and developing AI models capable of the type of independent, autonomous work that agents can do.\n\nThink of AI agents as specific medicines prescribed for particular conditions, while agentic AI is the entire field of pharmaceutical science that develops all medications.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is in the context of artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 the future goal of one day creating AIs that are generalists rather than specialists, capable of any task we ask them to help out with.\n\nToday\u2019s AI agents are not AGI \u2013 and they probably won\u2019t be for a few years yet. Yes, they can carry out complex tasks, but still only specific tasks they were created for. They can\u2019t really apply their learning to doing other things in the same way humans can.\n\nAgentic AI, however, is a field of AI research and development some believe will eventually lead to AGI. It includes building AIs that are capable of interacting with external systems \u2013 both digitally by interfacing with them and physically with robotics.\n\nSo, to put it in a very straightforward way \u2013 the term \u201cAI agents\u201d refers to a specific application of agentic AI, and \u201cagentic\u201d refers to the AI models, algorithms and methods that make them work.\n\n## Why Is This Important?\n\nAI agents and agentic AI are two closely related concepts that everyone needs to understand if they\u2019re planning on using technology to make a difference in the coming years.\n\nAs research and development into agentic AI continues, we will see increasingly sophisticated agents capable of automating many different tasks.\n\nTruly useful and personalized digital assistants, capable of learning about what we need in detail and taking steps to help us achieve it, will just be the start.\n\nIntegrated with robotics, agents will also open the door to the automation of physical tasks, such as complex construction or engineering work.\n\nWith the massive and rapid advancements we\u2019re seeing in AI, I think it\u2019s likely these changes will take place at a speed that will take many of us by surprise.\n\nStaying ahead of the curve now and understanding the latest developments in AI, robotics and automation is essential for anyone who wants to prosper in the new technological era.\n\n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BernardMarr) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/).\n\nCheck out my [website](https://bernardmarr.com/) or [some of my other work](https://bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1846).",
