<p>Vertical slice architecture is an approach to software design that emphasizes functionality over technical boundaries. Instead of organizing code by technical concerns (e.g., controllers, services, repositories), we organize it by features or vertical slices. Each vertical slice contains all the layers needed to fulfill a specific feature or functionality, such as UI, API, domain logic, and data access.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Vertical Slice Architecture</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improved Maintainability</strong>: By grouping related code together, it becomes easier to maintain and modify features without impacting unrelated parts of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Testability</strong>: Since each slice is independent, testing becomes more straightforward. You can test individual slices without worrying about unrelated system components.</li>
<li><strong>Better Collaboration</strong>: Teams can work on different vertical slices simultaneously with minimal conflicts, as each slice is self-contained.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Vertical slice architecture allows for different patterns and technologies to be used within each slice, making it easier to adopt new technologies or patterns over time.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Implementing Vertical Slice Architecture in .NET Core</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Define Your Slices</h3>
<p>Start by identifying the features or functionalities of your application. Each feature will become a vertical slice.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Create Feature Folders</h3>
<p>Organize your project by creating folders for each vertical slice. Inside each folder, include all the necessary components like controllers, services, and repositories.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Implement MediatR for Handling Requests</h3>
<p>Use MediatR to facilitate communication between components within a slice. Define request and response objects for each operation and create handlers to process these requests.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Dependency Injection Setup</h3>
<p>Register your handlers and other dependencies in the <code>Startup.cs</code> file to ensure they are available throughout the application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMediatR(typeof(Startup));
    // Register other dependencies
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 5: Testing and Refactoring</h3>
<p>After implementing your slices, thoroughly test each one to ensure it works as expected. Refactor as needed to maintain clean and efficient code.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vertical slice architecture provides a powerful way to organize and maintain software projects, especially as they grow in complexity. By focusing on features and functionality, teams can deliver more robust and maintainable codebases. Implementing this approach in .NET Core is straightforward and can lead to significant improvements in development workflows.</p><p class="meta"><strong>Posted by:</strong> <!-- -->Elijah Mondero<!-- --> on <!-- -->March 9, 2025 at 04:51:35 PM</p><p class="meta"><strong>Tags:</strong> <!-- -->Vertical Slice Architecture, .NET Core, Software Design, Clean Architecture</p><div class="meta"><strong>Sources:</strong><ul class="sources-list"><li><a href="https://dev.to/htech/exploring-vertical-slices-in-dotnet-core-3mik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.to/htech/exploring-vertical-slices-in-dotnet-core-3mik</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/s/pwDXRKWlhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/s/pwDXRKWlhw</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"id":"understanding-vertical-slice-architecture-in-net-core","title":"Understanding Vertical Slice Architecture in .NET Core","excerpt":"In this post, we explore the concept of vertical slice architecture, its benefits, and how to implement it in .NET Core.","content":"## What is Vertical Slice Architecture?\n\nVertical slice architecture is an approach to software design that emphasizes functionality over technical boundaries.
