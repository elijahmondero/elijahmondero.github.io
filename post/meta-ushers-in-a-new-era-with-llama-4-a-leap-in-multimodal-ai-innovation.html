The release includes LLaMA 4 Scout, LLaMA 4 Maverick, and a preview of LLaMA 4 Behemoth, each designed to deliver more powerful and personalized multimodal experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>LLaMA 4 Scout and Maverick: Leading the Multimodal Revolution</strong></h3>
<p>LLaMA 4 Scout is equipped with 17 billion active parameters and 16 experts, making it the world&#x27;s best multimodal model in its class. It stands out for its efficiency, fitting into a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, and offers an industry-leading context window of 10 million tokens. This model surpasses previous versions and competitors, achieving superior results across a wide range of benchmarks.</p>
<p>LLaMA 4 Maverick, also a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, excels in multimodal performance, outperforming industry benchmarks such as GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.0 Flash. It offers a remarkable performance-to-cost ratio and an experimental chat version with an ELO score of 1417 on LMArena, demonstrating its proficiency in reasoning and coding tasks.</p>
<h3><strong>LLaMA 4 Behemoth: A Glimpse into the Future</strong></h3>
<p>The LLaMA 4 Behemoth, a model with 288 billion active parameters and 16 experts, remains under training. Despite this, early performance indicators show it surpassing GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on crucial STEM benchmarks. LLaMA 4 Behemoth&#x27;s advanced capabilities make it one of the smartest LLMs globally, setting a new precedence in AI innovation.</p>
<h3><strong>Accessible AI for All</strong></h3>
<p>As part of Meta&#x27;s commitment to openness and innovation, LLaMA 4 Scout and Maverick are available for download on llama.com and Hugging Face. Additionally, users can experience LLaMA 4 through Meta AI in platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram Direct. Meta aims to ensure that the leading models and systems are transparently available to foster a new era of personalized AI-driven experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>Future Prospects</strong></h3>
<p>Meta&#x27;s introduction of the LLaMA 4 series signifies the beginning of a transformative phase for the LLaMA ecosystem. The company remains dedicated to advancing AI research, promoting openness, and providing developers and enterprises with the tools necessary to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into their products and services.</p>
