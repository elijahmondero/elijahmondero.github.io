<p>Post-World War II, the need for language translation spurred further research in NLP. The goal was to create machines capable of translating languages automatically.

<p>In the 1950s, Arthur Samuel&#x27;s work on machine learning with a checkers-playing program and Frank Rosenblatt&#x27;s creation of the Mark 1 Perceptron, an early neural network, were pivotal.

<p>The maturation of LLMs accelerated with the advent of deep learning techniques.

<p>Today, LLMs are trained using vast datasets and self-supervised learning methods.
