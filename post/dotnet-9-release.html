Here are some of the major highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>.NET Security</strong>: The .NET 9 release includes updated articles on cross-platform cryptography, providing enhanced security features to protect your applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breaking Changes</strong>: Several breaking changes have been introduced, including updates to nullability annotations, modifications to the BindingSource.SortDescriptions, and changes in the behavior of certain API methods. Notably, the In-box BinaryFormatter implementation has been removed and always throws exceptions now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>.NET Fundamentals</strong>: New articles and updates have been added, such as CA2022: Avoid inexact read with Stream.Read and CA2265: Do not compare Span<!-- -->&lt;T&gt;<!-- --> to null or default. Additionally, configuration source generators and code quality rules have been enhanced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SDK and Tooling</strong>: The SDK and tooling for .NET 9 have seen significant updates, improving the overall development workflow and providing better support for modern development practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C# 13</strong>: The latest version of C# introduces new features and improvements, including better conversion from collection expressions, ref struct allowed in interfaces, and enhanced support for async methods and iterators. The language also adds conceptual content for partial properties and better handling of compiler errors and warnings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These updates and many more make the .NET 9 release a significant milestone for developers, offering new capabilities and improvements to build more secure, efficient, and powerful applications.</p><p class="meta"><strong>Posted by:</strong> <!-- -->Elijah Mondero<!-- --> on <!-- -->February 18, 2025 at 10:19:04 AM</p><p class="meta"><strong>Tags:</strong> <!-- -->dotnet, .NET 9, C#, software development, programming</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"id":"dotnet-9-release","title":".NET 9 Release: What's New and Improved","excerpt":"Discover the latest features, breaking changes, and updates in the .NET 9 release, including new security measures, API changes, and improvements in C# 13.","content":"The .NET 9 release brings a host of new features and improvements across various components, enhancing the developer experience and expanding the framework's capabilities.
