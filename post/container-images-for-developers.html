<h3>.NET Developers</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet</strong>: This image is essential for running .NET Core and ASP.NET Core applications in a production environment. It includes the ASP.NET Core runtime and libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk</strong>: Ideal for development and build environments, this image contains the .NET SDK, allowing you to build and test your .NET applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime</strong>: A lightweight image that includes only the .NET runtime, perfect for running console apps and microservices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly</strong>: For those who want to stay on the cutting edge, this image provides the latest nightly builds of .NET SDK and runtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>ReactJS Developers</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>node</strong>: The official Node.js image is a must-have for React developers. It allows you to run your React applications and use npm or yarn for package management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>nginx</strong>: Often used as a reverse proxy, the Nginx image can serve your React applications efficiently in production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>cypress/included</strong>: This image includes Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework for JavaScript applications, making it easier to test your React apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>browserless/chrome</strong>: Provides a headless Chrome browser for running automated tests or rendering React components server-side.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Generative AI Developers</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>tensorflow/tensorflow</strong>: The official TensorFlow image is crucial for developing and deploying machine learning models, including those used in generative AI projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>pytorch/pytorch</strong>: This image is essential for developers working with PyTorch, another popular deep learning framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>jupyter/tensorflow-notebook</strong>: Combines Jupyter Notebook with TensorFlow, providing an interactive environment for developing and testing AI models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>nvidia/cuda</strong>: For those leveraging GPU acceleration in their AI models, the NVIDIA CUDA image is a must-have.</p>
</li>
</ol>
