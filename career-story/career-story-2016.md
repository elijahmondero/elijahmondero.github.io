# My Developer Journey: The New Zealand Chapter (2016)

The year 2014 marked a significant milestone in my life and career. After an incredible journey through the tech landscapes of the Philippines, the USA, and Singapore, I moved to New Zealand, a country I would soon call home as a Resident. At 31, with a decade of experience, I was ready for new challenges Down Under.

### A New Beginning Down Under

My Kiwi adventure began in the fast-paced world of FinTech and quickly transitioned into a leadership role.

**Fiserv (May 2014 - Nov 2014)**

I joined Fiserv, a global leader in financial services technology, as a Senior Software Developer. I was part of a large scrum organization, contributing to their "Mobiliti" mobile banking platform. The work was demanding and impactful, and my contributions to delivering key features were recognized when I was awarded **Most Valuable Player** for the month of September 2014.

**RAMM Software (Nov 2014 - Present)**

Seeking to make a deeper impact in a smaller, more focused team, I moved to RAMM Software. My journey here was one of rapid growth. Within three months, I was promoted to **Technical Lead** and became part of the three-person architecture team responsible for shaping the company's technical direction.

I led a crucial project to convert a legacy Delphi application to a modern ASP.NET MVC platform. I also championed modern development practices, introducing and establishing a **Gitflow workflow** and migrating the company's entire source code from SVN to Git on Team Foundation Server. I had the opportunity to design and develop core architectural components for caching, background job processing using Hangfire, and a foundational entity-based CRUD framework.

### Closing the Singapore Chapter

Before leaving for New Zealand, I concluded my time at CrimsonLogic as a Lead Software Engineer. We had successfully delivered and stabilized Singapore's first eLitigation system, a monumental project that I was proud to have contributed to significantly.

### The Tech Lab Evolves

My personal server, now at `mondero.net`, evolved with me. It became a full-fledged DevOps playground, hosting my own Git repositories, JIRA for issue tracking, and Bamboo for continuous integration. This lab was not just for learning; it powered my freelance projects, where I was building solutions for clients using ASP.NET MVC, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.

### My Toolbox in 2016

After 10 years, my toolkit had expanded to embrace modern web technologies:
*   **Languages & Frameworks**: C# (Senior), ASP.NET MVC, Web API, WPF, WCF, LINQ, Entity Framework
*   **Web**: AngularJS, Knockout.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, Typescript, SignalR
*   **Databases**: MS SQL Server 2005-2012
*   **DevOps & Source Control**: Git (Gitflow), Team Foundation Server (TFS), Subversion, Powershell
*   **Cloud & Tools**: Microsoft Azure, Hangfire, Unity IoC

### Awards and Recognition

My wall of achievements gained a new, cherished addition:
*   **Fiserv Limited, Auckland**: Most Valuable Player, September 2014
*   **AccountMate Philippines Corporation**: Special Merit Award for Development Innovation, 2007
*   **University of Cebu Banilad Campus**: Academic Excellence with Third Honors, 2006
*   **San Isidro Parish School**: Four-time Best in Computer Awardee, 1998 - 2002
*   **Colegio del Sto. Nino**: Third Honorable Mention Awardee, 1998
