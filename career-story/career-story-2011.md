# My Developer Journey: Circa 2011

In 2011, I was Elijah Nino Mondero, a 26-year-old software developer from the Philippines, making my mark in Singapore. My journey had already taken me from Cebu to California and now to the bustling tech scene of Singapore. Armed with a Cum Laude degree in Computer Science and a passion for building robust systems, this is my story up to that point.

### The Foundation (Pre-2006)

My fascination with computers started early, earning me the "Best in Computer" award four times in high school. This passion led me to the University of Cebu, where I graduated with Third Honors (Cum Laude) in 2006. My thesis, a "Pornographic Image Detection Software," was an early sign of my interest in tackling complex computational challenges.

### The AccountMate Era: A Filipino Developer in the USA (April 2006 – August 2010)

My professional career began at AccountMate Philippines Corporation. This wasn't just a job; it was an adventure. I was a pioneer, helping to introduce VB.NET development to the company. My work on a new .NET-based accounting system was so crucial that it took me to California, USA, not once, but twice (Feb-Jul 2008 and Aug 2009 - Feb 2010).

While in the US, I dove deep into the latest technologies. I attended seminars on .NET 3.5 at Microsoft Research in Silicon Valley and SQL 2008 in San Francisco. My contributions, especially in designing a dynamic and extensible reporting system using LINQ, earned me a **Special Merit Award for Development Innovation**. I was at the forefront of designing and developing the core framework for their new product line, working with WPF, WCF, and LINQ, and shaping their n-Tier architecture.

### The Singapore Chapter: High-Stakes Gaming at Xuenn (August 2010 – April 2011)

Seeking new challenges, I moved to Singapore to join Xuenn Pte Ltd as an IT Consultant. I was thrown into the fast-paced world of online gaming, working on `www.188bet.com`. The system supported thousands of concurrent users, demanding extreme stability, security, and performance.

My main project was "AgileBet," the second-generation system. I tackled critical concurrency and performance issues, redesigning parts of the trader's website and optimizing database stored procedures. I worked with a rich tech stack including C#, nHibernate, Spring, and Oracle. My efforts were recognized with positive feedback from leads and management, and I played a key role in the successful launch of a massive project.

### A New Frontier: Healthcare Tech at IHiS (May 2011 - Present)

In May 2011, I pivoted to a new industry: healthcare. As a Senior Software Consultant at Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), I applied my skills to improve applications vital to patient care. Within my first few months, I had already developed a "Disaster Recovery Tool" using Silverlight and WCF and was contributing to the "Webify" project, a web-based version of a critical clinical application, using C# and LINQ to SQL.

### My Toolbox in 2011

By this time, I had accumulated 5 years of professional experience. My toolkit was diverse:
*   **Languages & Frameworks**: C# & VB.NET (WinForms, WPF, WCF, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, LINQ)
*   **Databases**: MS SQL Server, Oracle 10g
*   **Methodologies**: OOP, Multithreading, N-Tier Architecture
*   **Source Control**: TFS, SVN, VSS

### Beyond the 9-to-5

My passion for coding didn't stop at the office. I was working on freelance projects like "Ovvio," an inventory system using ASP.NET MVC 2.0, and personal projects like "Project Julie," an n-Tier accounting system, and even a Pokémon game simulation using WPF and WCF. These projects allowed me to explore new patterns like MVVM and technologies like Entity Framework POCO.

### In Summary

By 2011, I had built a career on a foundation of academic excellence, a willingness to dive into complex problems, and a journey that spanned multiple industries and countries. From accounting software in the Philippines and the US to high-frequency online gaming and critical healthcare systems in Singapore, my story was one of continuous growth, learning, and impact.
