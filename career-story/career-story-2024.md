# My Developer Journey: The Cloud Engineering Chapter (2024)

Fast forward to 2024. With over 18 years of experience, my journey has evolved from a software developer to a Technical Leader specializing in cloud and platform engineering. My focus is on designing and building the scalable, secure, and maintainable systems that empower development teams and drive business goals. This is the story of my transition into the cloud.

### The RAMM Software Years: Solidifying Leadership (2014 - 2022)

My nearly eight years at RAMM Software were a period of significant growth and leadership. As a Lead Developer, I was at the helm of several key product teams, successfully delivering web applications for Road Assets Valuation and Contractor Claims. I was instrumental in the company's modernization efforts, pioneering their first .NET Core application and completing the full migration from Subversion to Git, establishing a robust Gitflow process that transformed our development lifecycle. As a Scrum Master and mentor, I helped grow the team's capabilities while ensuring we consistently delivered on our commitments.

### The MYOB Era: A Leap into Platform Engineering (2022 - Present)

In 2022, I joined MYOB as a Senior Developer, a role that quickly expanded into the realm of platform engineering on AWS. Here, I've had the opportunity to work on foundational systems that impact hundreds of developers and thousands of customers.

My work has been centered on enhancing the MYOB Advanced provisioning platform. I've led the design and delivery of several major initiatives:
*   **A secure debug provisioning system** to empower developers and support teams.
*   **A new, modern hosting platform** giving our Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) granular control over AWS resources.
*   **A new data collection platform** to enable business intelligence, starting with site telemetry.

I became one of the pioneers in our team for building out new microservices and infrastructure using **AWS Lambda, Fargate, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. This shift towards a loosely coupled architecture has been a game-changer for our platform's scalability and maintainability.

Beyond my core responsibilities, I'm always looking for ways to innovate. I developed a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using Azure OpenAI—a Slack bot that assists users with support questions and automates Jira ticket creation. I've also championed collaboration, earning two nominations for my efforts in facilitating pairing and mobbing sessions to mitigate risks and accelerate delivery.

### A Foundation Built Over Decades

This latest chapter is built on a foundation laid over many years and across multiple countries—from pioneering .NET at AccountMate in the Philippines and USA, to tackling high-concurrency gaming systems at Xuenn in Singapore, to delivering nationwide e-government solutions at CrimsonLogic.

### My Toolbox in 2024

My technical toolkit has evolved to embrace the cloud-native landscape:
*   **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, Fargate, S3, etc.), IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation)
*   **Languages & Frameworks**: C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET MVC & Web API, TypeScript
*   **AI**: Azure OpenAI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   **DevOps & Source Control**: Git (Gitflow), Buildkite, TeamCity, Azure DevOps
*   **Web**: React (via POCs), Knockout.js, jQuery

### A Legacy of Learning

While my personal server at `mondero.net` has been decommissioned, the spirit of that tech lab lives on. The countless hours spent on personal and freelance projects—from gaming simulations to gym management software—were my training ground for the complex challenges I solve today.

Today, I am a technical leader passionate about building great platforms, fostering collaboration, and leveraging technology to solve challenging problems at scale.
