# My Developer Journey: A Story of Evolution

My career has been a journey across countries, industries, and technologies. Looking back, a clear theme emerges: a passion for driving technological evolution. From migrating legacy systems to pioneering new frameworks, I've always been drawn to the challenge of building the future. This is my story.

### Chapter 1: The Foundation (Philippines & USA)

My fascination with computers began long before my professional career, earning me "Best in Computer" awards throughout high school. This led me to a Computer Science degree, where I graduated with honors.

In 2006, I joined AccountMate Philippines. It was here that my career's theme began to take shape. The company's flagship product was a robust ERP system built on Visual FoxPro. My mission was to help migrate it to the modern .NET platform. This was a monumental task, and I was proud to be at the forefront. My work was so integral that I was sent to California, USA, twice to collaborate with the core team, helping to design and build the new desktop application from the ground up. My contributions were recognized with a **Special Merit Award for Development Innovation**. Over four years, I grew from a Junior Engineer to a Senior, and eventually, to leading my own team. It was a proud moment, but just three months into my leadership role, a new adventure called.

### Chapter 2: The Singapore Hustle

Driven by a desire for new challenges and a better financial position to support my family, I moved to Singapore. My first role at Xuenn was in the fast-paced world of online gaming, where I delivered product features for a high-traffic betting site. When that role was made redundant, I quickly pivoted.

I joined Comtel Solutions as a consultant, deployed to their client, IHiS, Singapore's central healthcare IT agency. Here, I was again at the heart of a modernization project: migrating a critical clinical desktop application feature to the web.

My next role, at CrimsonLogic, became my proudest achievement in Singapore. I joined as a Senior Software Engineer on the team building **eLitigation**, the nation's first-ever electronic litigation system for the Supreme Court. I was involved in almost every aspect of the project, from developing core features to being deployed on-site at the Supreme Court's data center, giving me my first taste of what we now call DevOps. I even built a bespoke JavaScript framework, similar in concept to early AngularJS, which powered the `elitigation.sg` front-end portal. My contributions led to a promotion to Lead Software Engineer, but just three months into the new role, my journey took another turn as I prepared to move to New Zealand.

### Chapter 3: A New Home in New Zealand

Seeking long-term stability, my journey took me to New Zealand. My first role at Fiserv was a great introduction to the local tech scene and my first formal experience with Agile, working in sprints on their mobile banking platform. My dedication to delivering features was recognized when I was named **Most Valuable Player** for September 2014. However, with a growing family to support, I moved on after six months for an opportunity that offered better financial security, beginning a period where I was the sole income earner for our family for the next several years.

This led me to RAMM Software, a smaller company where I would spend nearly eight years. Though my title was Senior Developer, I carried the responsibilities of a Technical Lead. This role was the most front-end intensive of my career. We were migrating a legacy Delphi desktop application to a modern SaaS platform. This wasn't just any app; it was the asset management software used by nearly every council in New Zealand to manage the nation's roading infrastructure.

### Chapter 4: The Cloud and AI Frontier

In 2022, I moved to MYOB for a better financial position, a year that brought many positive changes. My wife began her own full-time tech career, and together, we bought our first home. At MYOB, I transitioned into a platform engineering role, quickly becoming a "go-to" developer for our AWS-based systems. I was recognized as a high-performer, leading initiatives to build new microservices and infrastructure using AWS Lambda and Fargate.

Seeking a company where I could build a long-term career with excellent growth prospects, I joined **Visa Inc.** in late 2024. While my core role involved migrating a legacy UI to React, I saw an opportunity to bring my passion for AI to the forefront. I joined a GenAI hackathon, and our "smart search" project was so successful it was greenlit as a major product initiative.

This work led to me being named Visa NZ's **Champion of Change** in May 2025, a global award recognizing my initiatives in evangelizing Generative AI. I became a member of the AI Champions community and earned my GenAI Ambassador badge, sharing my knowledge on LLMs and agent engineering across the company.

### The Path Forward

Today, I am a Senior Developer with my sights set on a senior Individual Contributor (IC) role, such as a Development Specialist or Principal Engineer. My journey has been defined by embracing change and driving technological evolution. From desktop to web, from monoliths to microservices, and now into the frontier of Generative AI, I am more excited than ever to continue learning, mentoring, and solving the complex challenges of tomorrow.
