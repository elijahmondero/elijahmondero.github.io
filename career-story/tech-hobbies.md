# My Tech Playground: A History of Hobbies & Side Projects

My passion for technology has always extended beyond my professional roles. My personal projects are my playground for learning, experimenting, and simply having fun with code. While many of these projects are now archived, they represent important steps in my journey as a technologist.

### The University & Gaming Era: Laying the Groundwork

Before I was a professional developer, I was a student, a gamer, and a tinkerer. My university years were filled with projects that went beyond the curriculum:

-   **Project Thesis:** My thesis was a "Pornographic Image Detection Software" written in VB.NET, an ambitious early dive into image processing and statistical analysis.
-   **Early Game Dev & Graphics:** I explored 3D graphics with a "Humanoid 3D Animation" in C++/OpenGL and even built a "3D Studio File Source Code Generator" in VB 6.0 to extract vertices for OpenGL applications. I also built a "Snakes and Ladders" game in Java to practice OOP principles.
-   **Running Game Worlds:** I got my first taste of practical IT by helping a local internet cafe with their networking. This led me down the rabbit hole of server management. I successfully hosted my own private server for the popular MMORPG, **Ragnarok Online**, called "[Ninjuro Ragnarok Online](https://ratemyserver.net/index.php?page=detailedlistserver&serid=14090&url_sname=Ninjuro%20Ragnarok%20Online)", using the rAthena emulator. I also ran a **[World of Warcraft](https://www.xtremetop100.com/sitedetails-1132330192)** server using TrinityCore, creating a Windows service to manage it. While these servers are long since down, they taught me about databases, server maintenance, and managing small online communities.

### The Professional & Side-Project Era: Deepening My Skills

As I began my professional career, my focus shifted to building more complex applications and taking on freelance work to sharpen my skills. These projects were my sandbox for testing new architectures and technologies.

-   **Ambitious Personal Projects:**
    -   **Project Emerald:** A simulation of a top-down Pok√©mon-style RPG using WPF and WCF duplex services. This was a personal challenge to tackle complex, real-time, multi-user server logic.
    -   **Project Julie:** A full n-Tier, domain-driven accounting system using an MVVM frontend, WCF services, and an Entity Framework (POCO) data layer.
-   **Freelance Work:**
    -   **[Clubfit](https://www.clubfitsoftware.com.au/):** As a freelancer, I worked on this cloud-hosted gym management system for a client in Australia. A key challenge was integrating various hardware entry systems (fob, fingerprint scanners) like InnerRange and Genie. The product is still active today.
    -   **Ovvio:** An ASP.NET MVC 2.0 inventory system for an online business networking group, built with Telerik controls and Entity Framework.
-   **Tooling & Automation:**
    -   **Autonomous Processor:** A custom build automation tool using SharpSVN and the MSBuild framework to create a continuous integration process.
    -   **Self-Hosted DevOps:** For years, I ran my own server under the now-defunct `mondero.net` domain, hosting my own Git repositories (Stash), bug tracker (JIRA), and tech blog. While the site is no longer active, the experience was crucial to my learning.

### The AI & Automation Era: The Current Frontier

Today, my hobbies reflect my professional interest in AI and automation, but with a creative twist.

-   **AI-Generated News:** My main project is **[The New Oracle](https://theneworacle.github.io)**, an AI-generated news blog. This isn't just a simple blog; it's a fully automated system powered by a multi-agent architecture. Every hour, a GitHub Actions pipeline kicks off, pulling news, having AI agents analyze and write articles, and then publishing them. It's a practical application of my passion for both AI and DevOps.
-   **Personal Blog:** I also maintain my personal blog, **[elijahmondero.github.io](https://elijahmondero.github.io)**, where I document my projects, learnings, and career journey.

From game servers to AI news agents, my hobbies have always been a reflection of my desire to learn, build, and explore the possibilities of technology.
