# My Developer Journey: The AI Champion Chapter (2025)

The next chapter of my career began in October 2024 when I joined the global powerhouse, Visa Inc., as a Senior Developer in New Zealand. This move marked a pivot towards a new set of challenges and an incredible opportunity to dive deep into my growing passion: Generative AI. With 18 years of experience behind me, I was ready to make an impact.

### Making an Impact at Visa

My primary role on the team was to help drive the migration of a critical employee management system from a legacy XSLT-based UI to a modern React frontend. Alongside this core delivery work, I contributed to broader engineering initiatives, including containerization efforts and the push for a test-first development culture.

However, it was in the realm of AI where I found a chance to make a truly unique contribution. Drawing on my experience building an AI-powered Slackbot at MYOB, I joined a GenAI hackathon in February 2025. My team's project, a "smart search" feature for the Spend Clarity product, was a success. It wasn't just a hackathon win; it was recognized as a major feature initiative for the product. As of June 2025, we are deep in the solutioning phase, working to bring this intelligent AI agent to production.

### Championing Change and Evangelizing AI

My passion for GenAI and the success of the hackathon project didn't go unnoticed. In May 2025, I was incredibly honored to be named the **Champion of Change for Visa NZ**, a global award within the Commercial and Money Movement Solutions (CMS-PD) group. This recognition was a direct result of my initiatives in Generative AI, from the smart search feature to my active contributions within Visa's AI community.

I was invited to join the "AI Champions" community, where I've had the privilege of sharing my knowledge by presenting on the foundational concepts of LLMs and the principles of agent engineering. My commitment to evangelizing this transformative technology was further recognized in June 2025, when I earned the **GenAI Ambassador badge** at Visa.

### The Path Forward

Today, I continue to serve as a Senior Developer, but my sights are set on a senior Individual Contributor (IC) path. I am actively working towards a future role as a Development Specialist or Principal Engineer, where I can continue to solve complex technical problems, mentor others, and drive innovation at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence.

### My Evolving Toolbox

My skills continue to evolve with the technological landscape:
*   **AI/ML**: Generative AI, Agent Engineering, LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   **Web**: React, TypeScript
*   **Cloud & DevOps**: Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), AWS, IaC
*   **Languages & Frameworks**: C#, .NET Core
*   **Methodologies**: Test-First Development, Agile

My journey has been one of constant learning and adaptation. From my first lines of code in the Philippines to leading AI initiatives at a global company in New Zealand, I am more excited than ever about the future and the problems yet to be solved.
