# My Developer Journey: The 2013 Chapter

By 2013, I was 28 years old with seven years of professional software development under my belt. My journey had led me to a new chapter in Singapore, working on a project of national significance. I had also established my own little corner of the internet at `ninjuro.com`, a server I maintained for personal projects, continuous learning, and hosting sites for fellow bloggers.

### New Challenges: From Healthcare to eGovernment

My transition into new domains continued. After my time in the high-stakes online gaming world, I moved into healthcare and then into the public sector.

**Comtel Solutions / IHiS (May 2011 - May 2012)**

As a Senior Software Consultant for Comtel, I was deployed to Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS). My role was to help modernize and maintain the clinical systems for Singapore's National Health Group. A major achievement here was the "Results Module Webify" project, where our team successfully converted a vital lab results module from a desktop application to a web-based system using ASP.NET, jQuery, and Ext.Net. This experience solidified my web development expertise.

**CrimsonLogic (May 2012 - Present)**

In May 2012, I joined CrimsonLogic as a Senior Software Engineer and took on the biggest challenge of my career yet: **eLitigation (www.elitigation.sg)**. This was Singapore's first-ever electronic litigation system, a massive project for the Supreme, Subordinate, and Family Courts.

As part of a 60-developer team, I was responsible for eight major modules, from development and testing through to production support. This often meant being on-site at the Supreme Court for deployments and load testing. I was able to provide technical expertise to my colleagues, help stabilize critical modules to achieve zero issues, and played a key part in the successful launch and UI refresh of this landmark system.

### The Passion Projects

My love for coding has always extended beyond my day job. I set up and maintained my own server at `ninjuro.com`, which became my personal tech lab. It hosted my Subversion repository, a Mantis bug tracker, and my personal projects where I could freely experiment with new technologies. "Project Julie," my personal accounting system project, was evolving into a full-fledged ASP.NET MVC web application.

### The Foundation

My earlier experiences at **AccountMate**, where I pioneered .NET development and earned a Special Merit Award during my trips to the USA, and at **Xuenn**, where I honed my skills in performance and concurrency for the online gaming industry, provided the solid foundation for these new challenges.

### My Toolbox in 2013

My skill set had grown deeper and more focused on enterprise web applications:
*   **Languages & Frameworks**: C# (7 years), ASP.NET & ASP.NET MVC, WPF (MVVM), WCF, LINQ, Entity Framework.
*   **Web**: jQuery, Ext.Net
*   **Databases**: MS SQL Server, Oracle
*   **Methodologies**: OOP, Multithreading, N-Tier, MVC, MVVM
*   **Source Control**: Team Foundation Server, Subversion

### Awards and Recognition

I remain proud of the accolades that have marked my journey so far:
*   **AccountMate Philippines Corporation**: Special Merit Award for Development Innovation, 2007
*   **University of Cebu Banilad Campus**: Academic Excellence with Third Honors, 2006
*   **San Isidro Parish School**: Four-time Best in Computer Awardee, 1998 - 2002
